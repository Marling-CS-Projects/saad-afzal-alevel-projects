# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

##

## Current Limitations of Project

* Level- I would like there to be more levels with a variety in each level
* Platform - Game can only really be played on computer browser
* Game perfrormance - Despite the game Performing decently well in numbers i still think it could perform better on a different software to Replit

I am confident In the Future with enought time I could not only implement these in the future but also improve on them potentially.Implementing these could improve the game significantly&#x20;

## Maintenance

As of now I only really have to fix and address the hitbox issue with enemies, in the future as the game expands keeping the maintenance at a passable and satisfying level will get harder and harder. Also with more stuff being added in the future the development becomes more time consuming so I would need to prioritize other plans over more time consming one&#x20;

### Size of game&#x20;

Right now I only need to fix the short term little bumps that are in the game given that I keep the game the same sizeas now with no additional things added.In order for me to address the "bumps" or bugs It would most likely require a couple more cycles and moderate changes to the code&#x20;

### Growth

In order for the game to properly grow I need to fix the bugs of the games state right now.Then i will need to assess What limitations the game has right now in the state it is in and then figure out how i could fix/Upgrade the limitations.

Introducing new features to the game would take a lot of time and be a bery time heavy process so in order to alleviate that load I could get on of my friends to help with the game.This would make the development quicker and any mistakes made could be caught out by someone else in order to keep the same standard of code&#x20;

## Future Development

### Short Term Bug Fixes

#### Bug fixes

Firstly I need to address the bugs in the game&#x20;

* Enemy Hitboxes - The hitboxes of the enemies are too big and out of proportion so maybe making a new sprite will help with that
* Frame rate - The Framerate of the game is due to the software limitations and the amount of sprites loaded, so In order to fix this I will make a new larger sprite which means i can load less of the same sprite

#### Scores and High Scores

I want to create a Score counter in the corner in which you collect a certain amount of keys across a  level and when you collect all keys you are able to move onto the next level. Also if i have the time i would like to add a timer of the fastest players who can complete the level and add it to a scoreboard that everyone who plays the game is on.

### Long Term Addressing Limitations

#### Current Limitations of Project

* Platform - Game can only really be played on computer browser
* Level - I would like there to be more levels with a variety in each level
* Game perfrormance - Despite the game Performing decently well in numbers i still think it could perform better on a different software to Replit

#### Platform support

To have better platform support for multiple devices i will need to use a different software  like phaser which will allow me to create specific binds and interfaces on different devices which will expand the player base of the game&#x20;

#### Levels

For levels I want to create a lot of them with different variety of enemies and obstacles, for eg instead of the enemy design I have for this level , the new enemies attack the player from range and also add traps for the player. I want to create 4 - 6 new levels&#x20;

Another idea is having new skins for the player to use giving an extra case of customization and the more the players plays the game the more skins they unlock and customizables

#### Game performance&#x20;

The graphics or  art style in my opinion and the responses given say that the it looks good and clean but in the future i would like to redesign some aspects of the sprites with more interesting menus and pause menus.Adding more colours and Pictures could help to add personality

## New limitations&#x20;

After a lot of added features there will be new limitations on the software that could potentially affect the game&#x20;



&#x20;Hardware - As the game gets bigger the hardware limitations are also put on strain, better hardware will be required to run the game&#x20;
