# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                       | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Avoiding enemies across the level | Success      |
| 2           | Clear goal by collecting key      | Success      |

### Feature 1

Adding enemies was effective as due to their design they were meant to be avoided , the enemies are quite a contrasting colour to other designs and look Like generic monsters in a dungeon crawler.There is no change needed for these sprites

### Feature 2

Adding a Bright Key as the goal makes it clear what the player needs to collect in order to win which makes it really effective at its job.The goal is easy to understand and in the future i could add a timer In order to give incentive to play the game again&#x20;

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                           | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Menus and tutorial is easy to understand and navigate | Success      |
| 2           | Precise and easy controls                             | Success      |

### Feature 1

The menu I made is very basic and easy to understand.In all honesty i could have done a lot more to make it appealing to players by giving it more colour and personality but overall im happy with the menu as it does its job

### Feature 2

The controls are precise and easy to understand as I have made a tutorial which highlights what the controls are, The conrols are the standard W,A,S,D and space bar so it is easy to understand.I have no reason to change them

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description         | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Length of the level | Fail         |
| 2           | Art style           | success      |

### Feature 1

The game in my opinion doesnt last as long as I intended to do,which might leave the player dissatisfied.In the future I would like to make more levels with a variety of enemies in order to keep the game fresh and keep the players engaged

### Feature 2

The general consensus was that the art style was good as most of them responded very positively to the art direction of the game. I used very muted colours for the dungeon itself and the characters but for the enemies and key I made sure that the colours completely contrasted

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description            | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game did not crash | Success      |
| 2           | The game has no bugs   | Fail         |

### Feature 1

After constantly testing the game with added stress involved the game still ran decently well and did not crash nor did i get informed by any of the responses of a game crashing.I will try to maintain this in the future of the game.

### Feature 2

I regret to say that despite the users reporting no immediate bugs, one bug i found is the hitboxes for the enemies being a bit bigger than usual.This could be due to the sprite i made being a bit off an odd shape so when loaded in it doesnt take into account perfectly the outline of the enemies

### Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Controls    | Success      |

### Feature 1

As previously brought up The controls are not only easy to learn but also precise which means the player doesnt have to spend much time to remember as they are controls that many a game use on keyboard
