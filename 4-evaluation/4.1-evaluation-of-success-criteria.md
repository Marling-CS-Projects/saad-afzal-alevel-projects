| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1         | The levels should consists of clear walls  and able to be traversed easily | Usability testing ,cycle 4       |
| 2         | The level is consistent in design                                          | Usability testing, cycle 2 and 3 |
| 3         | The levels are somewhat challenging                                        | not met                          |

| 5         | Add Enemies into the game                                                  | Cycle 5                          |

### Criterion 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The game has very clear and consistent walls and being able to be traversed easily is only confirmed by the usability testing in which the general consensus was that the level was easy to traverse

## Criterion 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The game is consistent with its pixelated design and in the usability testing this is confirmed by the responses that the arstyle is good and consistent

## Criterion 3

The reason I have not met this Criterion is because I didnt make enough ways for the player to really lose and challenge themselves when it comes to difficulty which led to the overall consensus that the game was easy&#x20;

## Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This criterion was met as shown in the picture With the sword being able to be used as an item which is able to swing in a 360 motion&#x20;

## Criterion 5

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This criterion was met as shown in the picture I added the enemies into the game, they are spread out through out the level
