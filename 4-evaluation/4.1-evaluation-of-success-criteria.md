# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Levels

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                                                                | When was it achieved             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1         | The levels should consists of clear walls  and able to be traversed easily | Usability testing ,cycle 4       |
| 2         | The level is consistent in design                                          | Usability testing, cycle 2 and 3 |
| 3         | The levels are somewhat challenging                                        | not met                          |
| 4         | The level includes items that are usable (eg.sword)                        | Cycle 5                          |
| 5         | Add Enemies into the game                                                  | Cycle 5                          |

### Criterion 1

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The game has very clear and consistent walls and being able to be traversed easily is only confirmed by the usability testing in which the general consensus was that the level was easy to traverse

## Criterion 2

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The game is consistent with its pixelated design and in the usability testing this is confirmed by the responses that the arstyle is good and consistent

## Criterion 3

The reason I have not met this Criterion is because I didnt make enough ways for the player to really lose and challenge themselves when it comes to difficulty which led to the overall consensus that the game was easy&#x20;

## Criterion 4

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This criterion was met as shown in the picture With the sword being able to be used as an item which is able to swing in a 360 motion&#x20;

## Criterion 5

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This criterion was met as shown in the picture I added the enemies into the game, they are spread out through out the level

## User Interface

| Criterion  | Description                                             | When it was acheived |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 12         | Easy to use menu                                        | Usability testing    |
| 13         | Easy to navigate throught the levels                    | Usability testing    |
| 14         | Player should be able to pause the game                 | Cycle 8              |
| 15         | Player will go to lose screen when colliding with enemy | Cycle 8              |

## Criterion 12

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The Criteria for this had been met as shown in the picture the menu is simple and easy to use and according to the usability testing The general response and consensus is that the menu is simple to use&#x20;

## Criterion 13

The Usability Testing proves that the responses were overall very positive when talking about navigating throughout the level proving i have met this criterion

## Criterion 14

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This criterion has been met in the cycle 8 in which i created a pause menu that is easy to understand and access

## Criterion 15&#x20;

This criterion was also met in cycle 8 In which I created a lose scene that is triggered when  colliding with the enemy, Also being able to return to the main menu from the lose scene and also going back into the game straight from the lose scene

## Non-Functional

| Criterion | Description                                    | When was it achieved                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 16        | Game should be aimed at 12 year olds and older | not met                             |
| 17        | Game must run succesfully without crashing     | usability testing                   |
| 18        | Should run at a minimum of 25 fps              | Testing for function and Robustness |
| 19        | Game will be made with clear colours           | not met                             |

## Criterion 16&#x20;

The reason I have not met this criterion is because the game I made is more centered towards people who are 12 and younger, given the ease of the level , the explicit tutorial and Pixelated artstyle

## Criterion 17

In the Usability testing the Responses showed that 100% of the responses agree that the game runs smoothly without crashing&#x20;

## Criterion 18

This criterion was met and proved in the testing for Function and Robustness as there is evidence that my game runs at 25 fps and above consitently without any problems&#x20;

## Criterion 19

The Criterion for this was not met as despite the fact that my levels consist of several different contrasting colours including the enemies, walls, player and items.The main goal was to have a more colourful menu and pause menu but due to priority being more towards the actual level i didnt have the time to do it&#x20;



## Mechanics

| Criterion | Description                                                       | When was it achieved          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 6         | Movement for the character that is easy                           | Usabilty features and cycle 2 |
| 7         | Collisons with physics                                            | cycle 2 and cycle 3           |
| 8         | Camera fixed on character                                         | Cycle 4                       |
| 9         | Sword following the player                                        | Cycle 5                       |
| 10        | Sword swings                                                      | Cycle 5                       |
| 11        | Player picking up items                                           | not met                       |
| 12        | Player gaining Experience points to level up and getting stronger | not met                       |

## Criterion 6

This Criterion was met in the Usability Features as I asked the a Question on whether the Controls were easy to use and the response was overwhelmingly positve with 100% agreeing that they were easy to use

## Criterion 7

This criterion was met in cycle 2 and 3 where in the testing I pointed out that the players does indeed collide with the walls and has general physics

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Criterion 8

This criterion was met in cycle 4 where I specifically set out to get the camera to follow the player and was successful in doing so&#x20;

## Criterion 9

This Criterion was met in the cycle 5 in which i got the sword to follow the player around while moving so he is able to use it as an item

## Criterion 10

This criterion was met in Cycle 5 in which i not only got the sword to follow the player but also get the sword to swing in a 360 motion proving i have met this criterion

## Criterion 11

This Criterion was not met as Trying to get the player to pick up items rather than just spawning in with them was rather difficult and more time consuming so i decided not to and instead focus on other criteria that needed to be met&#x20;

## Criterion 12

This Criterion was not met as this criterion was very hard to do in code compared to other criterion that needed to be done and way more time consuming compared to other criterion.Coding a set amount of experience for a character then coding it so the character gets stronger was very complicated for me to code&#x20;
