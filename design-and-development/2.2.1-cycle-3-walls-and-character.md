# 2.2.1 Cycle 3 - Walls and Character

### Objectives

In this cycle I aim to make a somewhat detailed character and detailed walls on the side of the level, giving the charcter more detail will entice more players to play the gamee and also give the game more personality.The walls on the side will start the main bulding blocks for the design for my level.

* [x] Add detailed walls on the side of the level and make it solid&#x20;
* [x] Detailed character&#x20;

### Usability Features

There are no additional usabuility features in this cycle&#x20;

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Wall          | Creates the wall , it divulges the necessary info to create the platform |
| Solid         | turns the wall into a solid so the player can collide                    |



### Pseudocode

<pre><code><strong>Loadsprite(Wall)
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>Class Levelconfiguration
</strong><strong> width : 16
</strong><strong> Height : 32
</strong><strong> 
</strong><strong>Class level
</strong><strong> "L                                L"
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>"w" => 
</strong> loadsprite wall()
 area of wall()
 wall solid()
 Scale of wall(2)  
 
</code></pre>

## Development

### Outcome

&#x20;in this cycle I managed to make the walls succesfully and implement it into the game properly , I also designed a detailed enough character that blends in and mesh well with the background&#x20;



### Challenges

One challenge I had was correctly scaling the wall to player and level in general.The sprites of the wall would intertwine with each other and look quite odd so to fix that i had scaled the wall down and make larger gaps in between input the sprite i.e instead of&#x20;

It looks like this:

Even then the sprites are a bit off and the colour sort of stands out compared to the rest of the level , it might be a problenm ill address later on&#x20;



## Testing

### Tests

| Test | Instructions     | What should happen                                        | What happens  | Pass/fail |
| ---- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code         | Walls succesfully loaded in and able to be collided with  | as expected   | pass      |
| 2    | Run code         | New character model succesfully loaded in                 | as expected   | pass      |
