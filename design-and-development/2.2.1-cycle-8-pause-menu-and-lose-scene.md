# 2.2.1 Cycle 8 - Pause menu and lose scene

### Objectives

In this cycle I want to Mainly focus on adding a Pause menu and lose menu, I would likely that the pause menu be assigned to a key that is easy to understand and Make the pause menu easy to understand. For the lose i would like to make it able to restart the game straight away with a click on the text

* [x] Make a Pause menu that is clear and make it explicit in tutorial how to pause
* [x] Go to lose scene when colliding with enemy
* [x] Go straight to game after lose scene

### Pseudocode

```
when player collide with enemy 
   go to lose

when player collide with enemy1 
   go to lose

when player collide with enemy2 
   go to lose



New scene lose {
  add text You Lose! :(
  pos vector 400 350
  scale 0.5 0.5
  area
  origin center
  
  
  add text Go back to menu ==> 
  pos vector 400 650
  scale 0.5 0.5
  area
  origin center
  "back"
  
  add text Try again ==>  
  pos vector 1300 650
  scale 0.5 0.5
  area
  origin center
  "Straight"
  
  when click on "back"
   go to start scene
   
   when click on "Straight"
   go to game scene

```

```
When pressing key enter
 go to pause


Scene pause 
add text paused
pos vector 400 350
origin center 
area
scale 1 1

add text resumed
pos vector 400 650
origin center
scale 1 1
area
"pause"
 
 When pressing key enter
 go to game
```

## Development

The development for this cycle was reletively Stressfree as making new scenes is nothing too hard or new with this project , At first i made the lose scene so when the charcter collides with an enemy it goes straight to the lose screen, Later on i though that adding a onclick function which could either go back to the main menu or go straight to the game scene would not only be better for practicallity but also ease when playign the game, they would have more incentive to play the game again if the try again button was in an easy position, here is the code for the lose scene

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="lang-javascript">Player1.onCollide("enemy",()=>{
  go("lose")
  
 })
 Player1.onCollide("enemy1",()=>{
  go("lose")
   
 })
   Player1.onCollide("enemy2",()=>{
  go("lose")
   
 })
<strong>
</strong><strong>scene("lose", () => {
</strong>   add([
     text("You Lose!     :("),
      pos(vec2(400,350)),
      scale(1,1),
      area(),
      origin("center"),
      
 ])

  add([
      text("Go back to menu ==> "),
      pos(vec2(400,650)),
      scale(0.5,0.5),
      area(),
      origin("center"),
      "back"
 ])
  add([
      text("Try again ==> "),
      pos(vec2(1300,650)),
      scale(0.5,0.5),
      area(),
      origin("center"),
       "Straight"
    ])
 onClick("back", () => {
    go("start")
    })
  onClick("Straight", () => {
    go("game")
    })
})
</code></pre>

For the pause scene I decide that instead of an onclick function i would use a Onkeypress function as it would be more suitable considering all the inputs are on the keyboard, I assigned it to enter to go to the pause scene and then press enter again to go back into the game scene, I made sure to explicitly state in the tutorial the enter key is needed to pause. Here is the code

```javascript
onKeyPress("enter", () => {
    go("pause")
    })
    
    scene("pause", () => {
   add([
     text("Paused"),
      pos(vec2(400,350)),
      scale(1,1),
      area(),
      origin("center"),
     ])
   add([
     text("Resumed"),
      pos(vec2(400,650)),
      scale(1,1),
      area(),
      origin("center"),
     "pause"
     ])
   
     onKeyPress("enter", () => {
    go("game")
    })
  
     

})



```





### Challenge&#x20;

One Challenge for this cycle was getting the player to collide with the enemy, then going to the lose scene . This was a challenge only because at first when i assigned the enemy to "enemy" and then wrote the player1.collide code ,The player wouldnt go to the lose scene so in order to get around this i had to make multiple different enemies and then assign them "enemy" , "enemy1" , "enemy2" respectively and then giving all of them their own collide functions which go to the lose scene

```javascript
Player1.onCollide("enemy",()=>{
  go("lose")
   
 })

 Player1.onCollide("enemy1",()=>{
  go("lose")
   
 })
   Player1.onCollide("enemy2",()=>{
  go("lose")
   
 })
```

Another challenge was at first i had onClick function instead of ONkeypress as i had not used it before, after a while i had concluded that having a keybind pause instead of clicking on a vutton would be more efficient when pausing but at the time i didnt know what onkeypress was until i searched on kaboom.js website and then switched it out for the onClick

```javascript
onKeyPress("enter", () => {
    go("pause")
    })
     onKeyPress("enter", () => {
    go("game")
    })
```

## Testing

### tests

| Test | Instructions                    | What should happen               | What happens  | Pass/fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                        | Game runs normally               | as expected   | pass      |
| 2    | press enter                     | goes into pause menu             | as expected   | pass      |
| 3    | press enter again in pause menu | goes back to game                | as expected   | pass      |
| 4    | collide with enemy              | goes straight to the lose screen | as expected   | pass      |
| 5    | click on go back to menu        | goes to main screen              | as expected   | pass      |
