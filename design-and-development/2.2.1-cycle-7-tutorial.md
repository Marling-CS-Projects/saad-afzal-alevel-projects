### Objectives

In this cycle I want to Primarily make a tutorial that is clear and explicit on what the controls are , the main objective and a button which sends you straight to the main menu and also straight to the game&#x20;

* [x] Make a clear tutorial with explicit controls on what to do
* [x] Go back to menu&#x20;
* [x] Go straight to game&#x20;

### Pseudocode

```
 scene tutorial 
 
  add sprite player 1
  pos vector 100, 500
  origin center
  scale 3,3
  
  add text "Use the space bar to attack"
  pos vector 800 550
  origin center
  scale 0.5,0.5
  
  add text "Use the W to move up"
  pos vector 800 250
  origin center
  scale 0.5,0.5
  
  add text "Use the S to move down"
  pos vector 800 350
  origin center
  scale 0.5,0.5
  
  add text Use the A and D to move left and right
  pos vector 800 450
  origin center
  scale 0.5,0.5
  
  add text "Make sure to collect the key"
  pos vector 800 550
  origin center 
  scale 0.5,0.5
  
  add text " <== Go back"
  pos vector 200 650
  scale 0.5,0.5
  area 
  origin center
  "back"
  
  add text "Go to game ==> "
  pos vector 1300 650
  scale 0.5,0.5
  area
  "straight"
  
  
  onClick("BACK", () => {
    go("start")
    })
  onClick("Straight", () => {
    go("game")
    })
```

## Development

The development for the tutorial was not too bad compared to other cycles and there werent too many setbacks, At first I created a new scene called tutorial then i added the multiples sections of code for the text inside the tutorial for the "go to game" and "go back" i assigned them the name "straight" and "back respectively, Lastly i added the on click functions onto bothe of them using the names assigned. "Go back" uses the code go("start") to go to the start scene or main menu and the "go to game" uses go("game") to go straight to the game scene. Here is all the code:

```javascript
scene("tutorial", () => {

  add([
    sprite("Player1"),
    pos(vec2(100,550)),
    origin("center"),
    scale(3,3)
  ]),
add([
      text("Use the space bar to attack"),
      pos(vec2(800,150)),
      scale(0.5,0.5),
      origin("center")
    ])

  add([
      text("Use the W to move up"),
      pos(vec2(800,250)),
      scale(0.5,0.5),
      origin("center")
    ])
  add([
      text("Use the S to move down"),
      pos(vec2(800,350)),
      scale(0.5,0.5),
      origin("center")
    ])
  add([
      text("Use the A and D to move left and right"),
      pos(vec2(800,450)),
      scale(0.5,0.5),
      origin("center")
    ])
   add([
      text("Make sure to collect the key"),
      pos(vec2(800,550)),
      scale(1,1),
      origin("center")
    ])
  add([
      text("to open door!"),
      pos(vec2(800,600)),
      scale(1,1),
      origin("center")
    ])
  add([
      text(" it will definitely work :)  "),
      pos(vec2(800,650)),
      scale(0.25,0.25),
      origin("center")
    ])
  add([
    text("Try to defeat the invincible enemy!")
  ])
  add([
      text(" <== Go back"),
      pos(vec2(200,650)),
      scale(0.5,0.5),
      area(),
      origin("center"),
      "BACK"
    ])

add([
      text("Go to game ==> "),
      pos(vec2(1300,650)),
      scale(0.5,0.5),
      area(),
      origin("center"),
       "Straight"
    ])

  
   onClick("BACK", () => {
    go("start")
    })
  onClick("Straight", () => {
    go("game")
    })
    
})


```





### Challenge&#x20;

For this cycle there were no real setbacks except for getting the text into the right positions with the vector numbers and getting the indentations right



## Testing

### tests

| Test | Instructions                   | What should happen        | What happens  | Pass/fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code                       | tutorial button shows up  | as expected   | pass      |
| 2    | click on tutorial              | goes into tutorial        | as expected   | pass      |
| 3    | click on "go back"             | goes back to main menu    | as expected   | pass      |
