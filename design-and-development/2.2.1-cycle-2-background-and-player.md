# 2.2.1 Cycle 2 - Background and Player

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I wanna focus on making the background and platform to stand on good. I also want to focus on making the character jump succesfully

* [x] Making the character jump successfully
* [x] make a detail background&#x20;
* [x] make a detailed platform
* [x] Create the outline for enemies

### Usability Features

Character movement- Making the character jump succesfully will allow for more options for movement and being able to reach places for items in the game.

Background- making the background will make the game more detailed and nuanced while also giving the game more life and expression which in turn makes the game more likable and enjoyable.
