# 2.2.1 Cycle 2 - Background and Player

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle I wanna focus on making the background and platform to stand on good. I also want to focus on making the character jump succesfully

* [x] Make a detail background&#x20;
* [x] Make a detailed character&#x20;
* [x] Character moves up,down,left and right&#x20;

### Usability Features

Character movement- Making the character jump succesfully will allow for more options for movement and being able to reach places for items in the game.

Background- making the background will make the game more detailed and nuanced while also giving the game more life and expression which in turn makes the game more likable and enjoyable.

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Speed         | Speed of how fast the player moves the character                   |
| Space         | Allows the player to jump and have more control of their character |
| Left/Right    | allows the player to move left and right                           |
| up/down       | allows the character to move up and down                           |

### Pseudocode

```
loadDrawing("Background","sprites/Background.pedit")

const level = {
  width: 16,
  height: 32,
  pos: vec2(0, 0),
   "b": () => [
    sprite("Background"),
    area(),
    layer("bg"),
    scale(2),
    
  ],

const direction = {
		"a": LEFT,
		"d": RIGHT,
		"w": UP,
		"s": DOWN,
	}

  for (const direction in dirs) {
	
	
		Presskey (direction, () => {
			Player1.move in direction.scale(SPEED))
		})
	}
  
  
  })
```

## Development

### Outcome

At first I decided to make the character sprite which i used to make by the in built replit sprite maker, the character is heavily inspired by the undertale style which is mentioned in my research and also hollow knight, It took me a while to make it look right,this what it looks like

The player is now able to move freely up, down, left or right at a acceptable speed .The size of the actual level is 16x32 , any bigger and the level would have been too big to traverse. I also made the background sprite which for now is just a black screen&#x20;

### Challenge&#x20;

One challenge i struggled with was actually making the character able to move up and down without him being grounded eventually though after digging around kaboom.js i found the reason was because I didnt code the directions properly and my character didnt know what to do.&#x20;

## Testing

| Test | Instructions           | What should happen                                           | What happens  | Pass/fail |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- | --------- |
| 1    | run code               | My Character to appear on screen and have a black background | As expected   | Pass      |
| 2    | Press "w" on keyboard  | Character moves up                                           | as expected   | pass      |
| 3    | Press "s" on keyboard  | character moves down                                         | as expected   | pass      |
| 4    | Press "a" on keyboard  | Character moves left                                         | as expected   | pass      |
| 5    | Press "d" on keyboard  | character moves right                                        | as expected   | pass      |
