# 2.2.1 Cycle 5 - Swinging sword and enemy

### Objectives

The objective this time is to make a sword sprite(that fits with the artstyle) which the character can use and get it to follow the player around while moving, Also being able to swing the sword in a 360 motion will be a main goal this cycle.Creating an enemy sprite&#x20;

* [x] Successfully make the sword sprite
* [x] Succesfully get the sword to follow the player while moving
* [x] Succesfully get the sword to swing in a 360 motion&#x20;
* [x] Succesfully make an enemy sprite&#x20;

### Usability Features

Space - Now swings the sword in order to hit enemies, easy to remember and use when inputting&#x20;

## Development

I began development by making a sprite for the enemy which i tried to do by finding a sprite on the internet but in the end i decided to make my own using the in built sprite maker in replit and i ended up making a very simple design to help with the time restraint

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

At first I wanted the enemy to move around in random directions and if the player gets near the enemy its starts to follow the enemy but dues to me not having enough time and the complexity of this I decided not to&#x20;

I loaded it in with the code&#x20;

```javascript
loadPedit("Bot","sprites/Bot.pedit");
```

I assigned the character to e and then input it into the code of the level which would allow me to test whether or not it worked&#x20;

```javascript
const LEVELS = [
  [
  " w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   d   w   w   w  ",
  "L                                                                           L",                           
  "L. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .L",

    "=  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  =  = ",
],
```

I then went Into the level config constant and gave the enemy area , made it a solid so you would be able to collide with it and gave it the tag "enemy"

```javascript
enemy = add([
	sprite("Bot"),
	pos(vec2(976,96)),
	area(),
	solid(),
  scale(5),
      "enemy"
    ])
  
```



For the Sword sprite i directly copied the sprite from a peice of media but in a pixelated artsyle, i made the sword using the in built sprite make in replit

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here is the code for it being loaded in

```javascript
loadPedit("DragonSlayer","sprites/DragonSlayer.pedit");
```

For the actual sword to be loaded into the level I gave the area() and pos() in order to get it to work, i also gave it the follow function and assigned it to my character and the postion vector 5,65 which would be around the players hands.Lastly i scaled it to 1.5 because the sprite wasnt big enough initially and making it any bigger would make it cover the whole player sprite

```javascript
const DragonSlayer= add([
	pos(),
	sprite("DragonSlayer"),
	origin("bot"),
	rotate(0),
	follow(Player1,(vec2(5,65))),
	spin(),
  area(),
  scale(1.5),
    "Sword"
])
```

The spin function added into the Dragonslayer sprite was very hard and somewhat confusing to get right, I got the idea for sword to spin like that from a playground on kaboom.js website this is what it looks like:

```javascript
function spin() {
	let spinning = false
	return {
		id: "spin",
		update() {
			if (spinning) {
				this.angle += 1200 * dt()
				if (this.angle >= 360) {
					this.angle = 0
					spinning = false
				}
			}
		},
		spin() {
			spinning = true
		},
	}
}
```

In the end the code managed to get the sword to spin and it worked pretty well

### Challenge&#x20;

One major challenge I had when making this was trying to get the sword to follow the player then i remembered the code in kaboom.js playground which had the code most of the code for me to help spin the sword all i had to do was assignt the spin into the dragonslayer when it loads in&#x20;

Another challenge I had was when making the sword a solid and putting solid() function on the sword it counted as a solid object so it being place into the charcactyers hands it coudnt walk with it because it would constantly collide so it wouldnt let me walk left in order to counteract this i just had to get rid of the solid function so the character could walk but it took a while to figure out&#x20;



## Testing

### tests

| Test | Instructions  | What should happen                         | What happens  | Pass/fail |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Run code      | Enemy sprite loads in the location I input | as expected   | Pass      |
| 2    | run code      | Sword sprite loads into the game           | as expected   | pass      |
| 3    | Press w       | Sword follows the player                   | as expected   | pass      |
| 4    | press space   | sword swings in 360 motion                 | as expected   | pass      |
