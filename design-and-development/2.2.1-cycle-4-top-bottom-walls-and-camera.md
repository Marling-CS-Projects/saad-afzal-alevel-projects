# 2.2.1 Cycle 4 - Rest of the level layout and Camera

### Objectives

I aim to make detailed walls on the top and bottom of the level,The walls will finish the main building blocks for the design for my level.Additionally I will try to get the "camera" to follow the player &#x20;

* [x] Add detailed walls on the top and bottom of the level and make it solid&#x20;
* [x] Add a Floor that fits with the theme of the design
* [x] Camera follows the player&#x20;

### Usability Features

There are no additional usabuility features in this cycle&#x20;

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Wall          | Creates the wall , it divulges the necessary info to create the platform |
| Solid         | turns the wall into a solid so the player can collide                    |
| camPos        | directs the camera into a certain position                               |



### Pseudocode

<pre><code><strong>Loadsprite(floor)
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>Class Levelconfiguration
</strong><strong> width : 16
</strong><strong> Height : 32
</strong><strong> 
</strong><strong>Class level
</strong><strong> "L..............................L"
</strong><strong> "L..............................L"
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>
</strong><strong>"." => 
</strong> loadsprite floor()
 area of floor()
 Scale of wall(2)
 layer of wall(background)  
 
</code></pre>

## Development

### Outcome

In this cycle I focused on making the floor and camera follow the player, I used kaboom.js playground as a base for my floor design and wall design , The code in this cycle is very similar to the previous cycle for the walls so there wasnt much of a problem when writing the code I assigned the floor as "." and the top and bottom walls as "w" and "=" respectively at first i made the floor just " " so the gaps in between the level layout in code are the actual floor, each individual space in between the layout was a floor sprite as shown here

But i found that this was inefficient as it was hard to keep track of every sprite of the floor so to make it easier i assigned the floor to "." which not only makes it easier to track every sprite but also lets me gauge where i can add other items onto the level. This is what it looks like

At first i had too many dots in each space which would cause the sprites to overlap and completely drop the fps of the game to 8 as it had too many things too load on a limited software hence the gaps between them&#x20;

The code for the camera to follow the player was relativley simple , i found the code on kaboom.js playground.

### Challenges

One challenge I had trying to find out how to get the camera to follow the player despite the fact it was only 2-3 lines of code i found the code on kaboom.js playground while trying to find inspiration  and research for what kind of sprites i will use, the code is:

```javascript
 Player1.onUpdate(() => {
	camPos(Player1.pos)
})
```

&#x20; The code for the camera was originally:

```javascript
player.onUpdate(() => {
    var currCam = camPos();
    if (currCam.x < player.pos.x) {
      camPos(player.pos.x, currCam.y);
    }
  })
```

Another challenge I had was getting the right amount of sprites for the floor as it would load too many causing the fps to drop so the solution was to assign the floor to "." to keep track of how many sprites are on the floor

```javascript
const LEVELS = [
  [
  " w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   w   d   w   w   w  ",
  "L                                                                           L",
