# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

In my success criteria, These two criterion fit the requirements for function and robustness, because the development has been stopped it is the perfect time to run these tests&#x20;

| Criterion | Description                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 18        | Game should Run Without Crashing or Breaking  |
| 19        | Game Should run at a Minimum of 25 fps        |

### Criterion 18

In order for me to test whether or not the game would crash i needed to put it under as much stress as possible, i did this by inputting weird inputs and things the game isnt really prepared for. It didnt crash but i found one or two bugs:&#x20;

* Sometimes if you snag the corner of the level where the corners collide the character walks through and is stuck indefinately outside
* Only once through the numerous times I pressure the game the sword would not follow the player properly&#x20;



### Criterion 19

Kaboom.js has a built in fps counter you need to press f1 while playing the game in order to see it, the fps usually sits at 27, the picture below shows the evidence for this.
