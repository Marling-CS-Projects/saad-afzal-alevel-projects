_**Gamers**_

Games have an enormous audience ranging from 2.69 bilion by the end of 2020 to a projection of 3.07 billion by the end of 2023 ([Gilbert, 2020](https://financesonline.com/number-of-gamers-worldwide/)).As might be expected because so many people play on daily basis, certian games have large or small demographics within the gaming industry, games like 2d platformers, action games and turn based RPG's are the more popular games in the industry. My game falls under a platformer/ turn based combat game which there are not many from research I conducted, im aiming to make the game appeal to a larger demographic with the turnmm based combat implemented&#x20;
