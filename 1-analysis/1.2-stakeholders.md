_**Gamers**_

Games have an enormous audience ranging from 2.69 bilion by the end of 2020 to a projection of 3.07 billion by the end of 2023 [(Gilbert, 2020)](../reference-list.md). As might be expected, so many people play on daily basis, certain games have a large or small demographic within the gaming industry, games like 2d platformers, action games and turn based RPG's are the more popular games in the industry. My game falls under a platformer/ turn based combat game which there are not many from research I conducted, im aiming to make the game appeal to a larger demographic with the turn based combat implemented into the game,one example of an incredibly popular game in this genre is undertale.Trying to understand what your players want is vital to the success of your game and how your game is developed.





## PEGI

![](<../.gitbook/assets/download (2).png>)



PEGI or Pan European Game Information is a system used throughout Europe to assess what ages are allowed to play certain games. It does this by accurately assessing the contents of the game for example, if a game has violence, drugs and gambling then it would definately not be a 3 or 7[(PEGI, 2017)](../reference-list.md) as a PEGI 3 game is only allowed mild violence in a comical form and 7 is essentially the same.

My game will most likely be a PEGI 12 as it would have mild language and violence that isnt in a comical or childlike setting might contain mild bad language so younger children will have a harder time playing the game.
