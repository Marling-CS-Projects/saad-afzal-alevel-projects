The gameboy was quite revolutionary for its time as it was easy to handle and consumers are able to take it everywhere. The way to navigate across different areas, Inventorys and menus is using the directional pad on the left. A and B where used by allowing you to either choose or back away from a certain action respectively.

### Story and World

The main objective of the game is to catch all 151 pokemon and become a pokemon champion by defeating the Elite Four. The way you do this is by catching pokemon of your liking and level them up, The pokemon themselves have a variety of moves, typings, weaknesses and strengths which all culminate into a fun and enjoyable experience.

The UI used is basic but effective enough for the consumer to have an easy experience playing the game. Viewing pokemons health ,stats and lvl is also quite easily accessible, although there really isnt anything like colour to make it stand out but this was 1996 and tech like that wasnt available yet.
