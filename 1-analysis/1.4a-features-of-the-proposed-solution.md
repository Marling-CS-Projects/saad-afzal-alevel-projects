# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Movement

The character the player will be controlling will be able to move around with a set speed, the player will also be able to make the character stop as soon as they let go of the key. A physics engine will also be implemented so the character is able to jump and fall back down, also when the character runs and jumps it increases the height of the jump

### Collisions

Collisions will allow the character to stay on specific platforms and when the player hits an obstacle it will collide and stop them from passing through depending on what they collide with.

### Controls

The controls for this game are going to be simple and easy to learn.They are A,D  to move left and right respesctively&#x20;

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
