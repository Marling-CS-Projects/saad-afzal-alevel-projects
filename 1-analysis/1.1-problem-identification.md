I chose video games as my project because the overall positive affect it can have on mental health. During Covid-19 lockdown, mental health has slowly waned as people were restricted and stuck in their homes for what seemed to be for the forseeable future and that can take its toll on people more than others. so as a means of escape people turn to video games.Video games can help socialize with others,overall boost confidence and reduce anxiety.
