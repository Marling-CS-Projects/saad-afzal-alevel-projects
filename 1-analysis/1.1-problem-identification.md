# 1.1 Problem Identification

The events of the last 2 years have definately taken its toll on the people,According to [(Cullen, Gulati and Kelly, 2020)](../reference-list.md) 54% of poeple who responded to a survey with COVID affecting their mental health Severley and 29% report that they are starting to gain moderate to severe symptoms of Anxiety.Naturally people resort to outlets in order to keep them sane in difficult times and one of the main outlets is gaming.

I chose video games as my project because the overall positive affect it can have on mental health. During Covid-19 lockdown, mental health has slowly waned as people were restricted and stuck in their homes for what seemed to be for the forseeable future and that can take its toll on people more than others. so as a means of escape people turn to video games.Video games can help socialize with others,overall boost confidence and reduce anxiety.[(Smirni, D., Garufo, E., Di Falco, L. and Lavanco, G,2021)](../reference-list.md) According to [(Bach, 2021)](../reference-list.md) an Xbox Research accesibility community feedback program looked at and researched players mental health during the pandemic, 84% of respondent claimed that gaming had positively impacted their mental health and 71% claimed that it helped them feel less isolated&#x20;

Another key point is that turn based rpg games are some of the oldest and most popular games to have been made. Dating back to the 90's  with games such as pokemon, final fantasy, Dragon quest etc.Pokemon is one of the highest grossing franchises of all time [(Anon, 2019)](../reference-list.md)&#x20;
