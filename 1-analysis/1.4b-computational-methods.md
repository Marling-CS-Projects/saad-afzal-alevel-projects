# 1.4b Computational Methods

## Computational thinking

Computational thinking is when you take a complex problem and break it down into smaller peices which are much more manageable for example creating a list of task that need to be done by the end of the week, you would then break down the task that are needed to be done into smaller much more easy daily tasks.

## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Abstraction is essentially removing uneeded details from a problem so you are able to focus on the core parts of the problem first. Abstraction is important for game design because it allows you to input all of your focus on the core features of your game,making it overall better for the player.Important features include:

* Stage layout - The basic stage layout doesnt need to be complicated, it will consist of characters enemies and potentially usable items&#x20;





## Thinking Ahead

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

## Thinking Logically

## Thinking Concurrently
