# 2.2.1 Cycle 1 - Testing Kaboom

## Design

### Objectives

In this cycle, I aim to create a really basic layout for my game using Kaboom.js. I will make a shape correspond to inputs made by the keyboard.

* [x] Set up Kaboom.js
* [x] Make a platform&#x20;
* [x] Make up a character &#x20;
* [x] Make the character move with keyboard input

### Usability Features

Keyboard Input - The keyboard inputs will be a simple left and right, so as to just provide movement for now. It is also easy to remember the controls and what they do.
